# Counting the number of Galaxies and more
project work
used openCV and dfs and bfs connected components algorithm
Tech Stack: C++, Python
This project uses Depth-First-Search connected component and computer vision. A cosmological image is thresholded, then extracted a 2D binary matrix from the thresholded image. The algorithm then works on this 2D matrix to count the number of galaxies.

With the help of basic image processing initially converted the image into a grayscale image, and then, using the threshold function converted it into a binary image.
The Binary image has only two pixels 0 and 1 or one can say that a binary image is a 2D Binary matrix comprising of only 0 and 1.  Firstly compressed the picture since the image size was large and converted into 2D Binary matrix.
Then used this 2D Binary matrix as input for our program.

Data collection
The image dataset is collected from NASA's Hubble telescope site (http://hubble.nasa.gov/ ).
